Follow these instructions to access and edit the course materials with Obsidian, a free and open-source software (FOSS) that enables a note-taking and knowledge-building workflow, allowing you to connect ideas together. We will explore this workflow as we progress through the workshop.

Obsidian is highly recommended for this workflow, but you can follow along with the files on your computer without it. The individual files will open in any plain text editor, like NotePad or TextEdit.

## 1. Download the Course Materials

- [Visit this link](https://github.com/cmadland/PAC-U/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the course materials to your computer.
- Expand the compressed file.
- Rename the folder "PACU"
- This is a folder of plain text files that lives on your computer.

## 2. Download Obsidian

- Go to <https://obsidian.md> and download the app. Obsidian is a free and open source note-taking app with many features.

## 6. Using Obsidian

- Links in Obsidian are displayed in purple.
- Hold the CTRL or CMD key and hover links to get a preview.
- Obsidian is a little bit like a browser.
- Edit any of the content as we go. These files are yours to keep and make your own.
- Toggle between reading and editing with the 'book' or 'pencil' icon in the top right corner of each page.
- Use the [[Markdown Guide]] to help you style your notes.

## 7. Go to the [[Preparation]] file.

- Once you have installed Obsidian, open the [[Preparation]] file and follow the links to a brief survey and an article to pre-read and set the stage for our conversation on Monday.

## 8. Check the Agenda

- In the Index on the left side of the Obsidian window, you will find a link to the [[Agenda]], which contains links to each of the topics we will discuss and some very brief notes.
- You are encouraged to make this vault your own by taking notes, building on the visual agenda (or creating your own canvas to connect your notes visually), and linking to other ideas.
- You can create new pages by putting the title of the page inside two sets of square brackets like this ->`[[New Page]]`, then CTRL+Click to open and edit the page. Try it with this page called [[What I want to learn]].
