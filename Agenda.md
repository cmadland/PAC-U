## Self-Paced Learning in Higher Education

The following is a tentative topical outline for a 2-day workshop intended to lay foundational groundwork to enable the Pan Africa Christian University to introduce self-paced learning to their academic offerings. The topics below are suggested as important for empowering staff and faculty of the Pan Africa Christian University to continue learning and building capacity for serving the needs of remote learners.

This agenda will be enacted via a blend of modalities, including synchronous, asynchronous, self-paced, and instructor-paced activities, and is open to amendment and feedback.
