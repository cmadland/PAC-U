Welcome to a brief journey into self-paced learning! This folder contains all the course materials that you will need to follow along with the in-person event at Pan Africa Christian University, or to catch up later if you are not able to join us in person.

These notes are yours! 

You are encouraged to edit, revise, add to, manipulate, personalize, and share your thoughts, questions, and criticisms along the way.
